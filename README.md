# Predict-Bike-Sharing-Demand-with-AutoGluon

In a Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand, participants are required to use the AutoGluon Framework and perform feature engineering on a dataset to predict the demand for bike-sharing. Bike-sharing is a convenient system that allows people to rent and return bicycles from a network of kiosk locations in a city. There are currently over 500 bike-sharing programs worldwide, and the data generated by these programs are useful for researchers as they record the duration of travel, departure and arrival locations, and the time elapsed. This particular dataset was provided by Hadi Fanaee Tork on the Kaggle platform.

The model used for this competition was created by Yousef Ahmad.
