# Predict-Bike-Sharing-Demand-with-AutoGluon
I used Amazon SageMaker with AutoGluon to predict bike-sharing demand and build stack ensembles, and regression models. The best model, improved by EDA and features, beat those with just hyperparameter tuning. However, AutoGluon's tuning varied in effectiveness due to setup limitations like time and presets.
